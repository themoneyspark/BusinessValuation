The previous AI engineer effectively built a comprehensive KGOB Admin Dashboard frontend, iteratively responding to user feedback and feature requests. Starting from a basic template, it progressively added core admin sections like user, billing, and support management with mock data. Key phases included initial dashboard setup, detailed billing enhancements, integration of critical CPA workflow modules (Report Management, Role & Permission, AI Management), UI refinements (login, header, logo), and most recently, foundational work for advanced admin profile features such as 2FA, detailed activity logs, and profile picture uploads. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in component creation, routing, mock data handling, and UI adjustments based on design guidelines and explicit user corrections, though some features are still in progress. The development adhered to a frontend-first, mock-data-driven approach, deferring backend integration.

The goal is to develop a comprehensive, desktop-only (1440px+ width) administration interface for a business valuation platform (KGOB). It targets platform administrators, support staff, and super admins, emphasizing data density, operational efficiency, clear hierarchy, real-time system status, and action-oriented tools. The initial build included a login page, and detailed sections for Dashboard Overview, Users Management (max 10-12 mock users), Billing & Revenue (with Stripe/Resend integration placeholders, detailed card/subscription info, user history, grouped transactions), Support Tickets, Coupon Management, Team Management, and System Health. Subsequent critical additions included Report Management (PDF upload, gating controls), Role & Permission Management (matrix, impersonation), and AI Management (AskSara controls, analytics). Medium priority features include Knowledge Base CMS, Advanced Audit Logging, Feature Flag Management, Notification Center, and Advanced Revenue Analytics. The design must reflect Kohari Gonzalez branding with a teal accent, professional aesthetic, and responsiveness. Admin profile features like logout, profile management, and password change were also requested, along with Google Authenticator 2FA, detailed activity logs, and profile picture upload.

    *   **Importance**: Main React application file, responsible for setting up  and .
    *   **Changes**: Initially included a basic Home component. Modified to include routes for  and  (which renders ).  and  constants were defined using .
*   **/app/frontend/src/mockData.js**:
    *   **Importance**: Centralized storage for all mock data used throughout the frontend components.
    *   **Changes**: Created from scratch to provide initial mock data for users, billing, support tickets, coupons, team, system health. Later enhanced significantly to include detailed billing information (card details, subscription periods, transaction types) and mock data for new modules like reports, roles, and AI management.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx**:
    *   **Importance**: The main container for the admin dashboard, including the top bar, left sidebar navigation, and the main content area which dynamically renders different admin sections.
    *   **Changes**: Created to define the core layout. Iteratively modified to integrate new navigation items and corresponding routes for , , , , , , and . The header design was extensively refined multiple times, from a basic layout to an overly fancy one, and then simplified to a clean, professional appearance. The admin profile dropdown with My Profile, Change Password, and Sign Out was added here.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/admin/AdminLoginPage.jsx**:
    *   **Importance**: Handles the admin authentication interface.
    *   **Changes**: Created to provide a login form with mock credentials. The mock credentials were updated from  to , and associated UI elements (labels, placeholders) were adjusted. The logo display was updated to use the latest image.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/admin/BillingManagement.jsx**:
    *   **Importance**: Displays and manages billing-related information for administrators.
    *   **Changes**: Initially created with basic billing metrics.

Includes mock actions for customer management.
*   **/app/frontend/public/index.html**:
    *   **Importance**: The main HTML entry point for the React application.
    *   **Changes**: Modified to remove the Made with Emergent badge and updated the page title and meta description to KGOB Admin Dashboard.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement Google Authenticator 2FA setup with QR codes.
-   Integrate and display detailed Activity Logs.
-   Implement actual profile picture upload functionality (beyond just UI).
-   Address and fix the misleading Resend integration display in the Billing section, as it's not useful for multiple website data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on enhancing the admin profile features. It had just completed creating two new components:  (for Google Authenticator 2FA setup) and  (for detailed activity logs). The AI then proceeded to update the  component. Specifically, it performed multiple edits to  to integrate the ability to add a profile picture and set up Two-Factor Authentication. The current state is that the basic structure and integration points for these features within  are being laid out. The last user interaction was a query about clearing memory, to which the AI provided a general explanation, indicating a brief pause in the core development flow but signaling that the development of  features (2FA, profile picture) is the immediate preceding task that was being worked on.
